# **ReHLine**
`ReHLine` is a software package for minimizing regularized composite ReHU/ReLU losses with linear computational complexity. It is implemented to be distributed and efficient with the following advantages:

- Solve various existing statistics/machine learning problems with **Linear** Models with **Linear** Computational Complexity.
- Support of flexible **ReHU/ReLU-Decomposable** loss functions and **linear** constraints.
